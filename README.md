Step 1:
-> Create a sophisticated game of Snake in Python. It should have a sophisticated GUI, 
  which records its own states (in some sort of way) with intention of recording instances
  of error.
  
* Which language will we be using? *
-> Python 3
 
* What are the steps it takes to make a game of Snake in Python? *

1. Install appropriate libraries
2. Create a game Screen
3. Create the Snake object
4. Make the Snake move.
5. Make sure it says 'Game Over' when the Snake hits the boundary edge.
6. Add the presence of Food
7. Increasing the Length of the Snake
8. Make sure it says 'Game Over' when the Snake hits it's tail.
9. Display the Score whenever the game ends.
10. Make sure it displays in the terminal how the game ended with record of score.
11. Make sure game states are stored in a standard formatting.

*How are we gonna document this?*

After successfully completing each step, save the most advanced state of the game to Master
- Document in the name the most complete version.

If a version isn't completely correct, save it as a branch.

Step 2:

- Create an AI mode that can start its own game.
- Use Tensorflow train the AI.
